					What is Token?
				</header>
				<p>
					Token is a simple private cryptocurrency and blockchain. It uses proof of work and soon proof of stake to get
					consensus among the nodes and network.
				</p>
				<p>The project is heavily inspired by Monero, Bitcoin, and Ethereum.
				</p>
				<br><br>
				<h3>What is blockchain technology?</h3>
				<p>In simple terms blockchain is a distributed ledger that checks the previous block making it a chain or for the programming Chads it's basically a linked list that uses the hash of the previous object
					to verify that it hasn't been tampered with. In order to prevent blocks from being tampered and added to fast there is typically a proof of work algorithm or some way to get consensus in the network.
					<br> The main pros of blockchain are:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Decentralization</li>
					<li>Security</li>
					<li>Trust</li>
					<li>Transparency</li>
					<li>Immutability</li>
					<li>Backed by cryptography and mathematics</li>
				</ul>

				<header>
					Transactions
				</header>
				<p>
					Transactions are sent out as POST requests on nodes and verified by miners
					here is an example to add a transaction.
				</p>

				<code>
					
					POST https://url_for_node:port/add_unconfirmed_transaction
					<br>
						{
							<br>
							sender:	str,
							<br>
							sender_signature: str,
							<br>
							receiver: str,
							<br>
							amount: float
							<br>
						}
				</code>


				<p>Nodes broadcast transactions differently 
					than users adding transactions. As to prevent poisoning 
					of transactions or data.
				</p>
				<code>
					
					POST https://url_for_node:port/add_transaction
					<br>
						{
							<br>
							   sender_public_send_key: str,
							   <br>
    							   sender_signature: str,
							       <br>
    							   receiver: str,
							       <br>
    							   transactionID: str,
							       <br>
    							   timestamp: str,
							       <br>
    							   amount: float
							<br>
						}
				</code>

				<header>
					Mining
				</header>
				<p>
					Mining adds blocks and only requires the public key of a wallet to add a block and verify transactions.
				</p>
				<code>
					
					POST https://url_for_node:port/mining
					<br>
						{
							<br>
							   public_key: str
							<br>
						}
				</code>
				<h3>Adding Or Announcing Blocks To The Network</h3>
				<p>
				Announcing blocks is a simple POST request to Nodes and the nodes will check the validity of the new block
				</p>
				<code>
					
					POST https://url_for_node:port/insert_block
					<br>
						{
							<br>
							   block: dict
							<br>
						}
				</code>

					Polymorphism
				</header>
				<p>
					The word polymorphism means having many
					forms. In simple words, we can define
					polymorphism as the ability of a message
					to be displayed in more than one form.
					A real-life example of polymorphism, a
					person at the same time can have
					different characteristics.
					Like a man at the same time is a father,
					a husband, an employee. So the same
					person posses different behavior in
					different situations. This is called
					polymorphism. Polymorphism is considered
					as one of the important features of Object
					Oriented Programming.
					<br>
					<b>In C++ polymorphism is mainly
						divided into two types:</b>
					<br> 1. Compile time Polymorphism<br>
					2. Runtime Polymorphism
				</p>

				<p>Compile time polymorphism: This type of
					polymorphism is achieved by function
					overloading or operator overloading.
					<br> Runtime polymorphism: This type
					of polymorphism is achieved by
					Function Overriding.
				</p>

				<header>
					Abstraction
				</header>

				<p>
					Data abstraction is one of the most
					essential and important feature of object
					oriented programming in C++. Abstraction
					means displaying only essential information
					and hiding the details. Data abstraction
					refers to providing only essential information
					about the data to the outside world,
					hiding the background details or implementation.
					<br> Consider a real life example of a man driving
					a car. The man only knows that pressing the
					accelerators will increase the speed of car
					or applying brakes will stop the car but he
					does not know about how on pressing accelerator
					the speed is actually increasing, he does
					not know about the inner mechanism of the car
					or the implementation of accelerator, brakes
					etc in the car. This is what abstraction is.
				</p>

				<p>
					<b>Abstraction using Classes:</b> We can
					implement Abstraction in C++ using classes.
					Class helps us to group data members and member
					functions using available access specifiers. A
					Class can decide which data member will be
					visible to outside
					world and which is not.
					<br>
					<b>Abstraction in Header files:</b> One
					more type of abstraction in C++ can be
					header files. For example, consider the
					pow() method present in math.h header file.
					Whenever we need to calculate power of a
					number, we simply call the
					function pow() present in the math.h header
					file and pass the numbers as arguments
					without knowing the underlying algorithm
					according to which the function is actually
					calculating power of numbers.
					<br><br><b>Advantages of Data Abstraction:

					</b><br> 1. Helps the user to avoid writing
					the low level code.<br> 2. Avoids code
					duplication and increases reusability.<br>
					3. Can change internal implementation of
					class independently without
					affecting the user.<br> 4. Helps to
					increase security of an application or program
					as only important details are
					provided to the user.

				<header>
					Encapsulation
				</header>
				<p>
					In normal terms Encapsulation is defined
					as wrapping up of data and information
					under a single unit. In Object Oriented
					Programming, Encapsulation is defined as
					binding together the data and the functions
					that manipulates them. Consider
					a real life example
					of encapsulation, in a company there are
					different sections like the accounts section,
					finance section, sales section etc. The finance
					section handles all the financial transactions
					and keep records of all the data related to
					finance.
					Similarly the sales section handles all the
					sales related activities and keep records of
					all the sales. Now there may arise a situation
					when for some reason an official from finance
					section needs all the data about sales in a
					particular
					month. In this case, he is not allowed to
					directly access the data of sales section.
					He will first have to contact some other
					officer in the sales section and then
					request him to
					give the particular data. This is what
					encapsulation is. Here the data of
					sales section and the
					employees that can manipulate them are
					wrapped under a single name “sales section”.
				</p>

				<p>
					Encapsulation also lead to data abstraction
					or hiding. As using encapsulation also hides
					the data. In the above example the data of
					any of the section like sales, finance or
					accounts is hidden from any other section.<br>
					In C++ encapsulation
					can be implemented using Class
					and access modifiers.
